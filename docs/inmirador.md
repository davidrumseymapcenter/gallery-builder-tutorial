# Saving and Sharing
There are many IIIF-compliant Viewers offering different ways of looking at and interacting with images. 

The Gallery Builder app breaks some IIIF rules in order to show individual pages from a multi-page volume. 

But you can export IIIF-compliant files and open those in other viewers. 

In the steps that follow you will compare the differences.

## 💾 Save for use in IIIF Viewers
- Name your gallery by typing a name in the field below “SAVE GALLERY,” or use the same name.

- This time, click on the **grey IIIF logo** in the lower right corner of the input window. 

- A file will be saved to your desktop with a name like "coolmaps-manifest.json". 

- The suffix “-manifest.json” indicates a file that can be opened with other IIIF Viewers like [Mirador](https://projectmirador.org/){:target="_blank"} or [Universal Viewer](https://universalviewer.io/){:target="_blank"}. 

>{: .highlight } 
>You will need to host your new manifest somewhere in the cloud to open it in those viewers.
