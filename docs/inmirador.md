# Saving and Sharing

Save for use in IIIF Viewers like Mirador

- Name your gallery by typing a name in the field below “SAVE GALLERY” or use the same name.

- This time, click on the **grey IIIF logo** in the lower right corner of the input window. 

- A file will be saved to your desktop with a name like "coolmaps-manifest.json". 

- The suffix “-manifest.json” indicates a file that can be opened with other IIIF Viewers like [Mirador](https://projectmirador.org/){:target="_blank"} or [Universal Viewer](https://universalviewer.io/){:target="_blank"}. 

>{: .highlight } 
>You will need to host your new manifest somewhere in the cloud to open it in those viewers. 
>You will learn how to do this in the next step.
