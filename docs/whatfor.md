## What's it for?

### Working with digital primary source sets
In the David Rumsey Map Center, we are using this tool to create and share sets of primary source material (mostly maps) with students and faculty who are visiting the center with classes. 

It is part of our internal collaborative process for making the selections that go into those sets.

### Creating abridged versions of longer texts

I have used it to create galleries that show all pages in a book that contain images. 

#### EXAMPLE

- This book, from the Getty Collection and shared on the Internet Archive: [Les papillons : métamorphoses terrestres des peuples de l'air](https://archive.org/details/lespapillonsmeta02nuse_0)

- This [gallery of illustrations](https://davidrumseymapcenter.github.io/set-builder/viewer.html?file=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidrumseymapcenter/set-builder/refs/heads/main/manifests/papillons.json) from that book.

### Visually-enhanced bibliographic Management

Management of information sources and citations is an important part of performing research.

Bibliographic management tools like Zotero simplify aggregation of textual sources. While they can be used for visual sources as well, it is helpful to be able see the image being referenced. This is especially true with items which do not have descriptive titles, or in collections where titles of multiple items are similar.
