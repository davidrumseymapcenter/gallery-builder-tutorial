### Image

- **Item thumbnail:** click this to open the image in the viewing pane

### Metadata

- **Title:** note that long titles are truncated after four lines
- **Author:** if source metadata lists multiple creator roles the card will only show the first one
- **Date:** date of publication
- **Collection:** any subgrouping of things the item is part of
- **Attribution:** information about the source institution or information on usage

Note that this is just a summary and metadata handling varies by institution. 
It is a good idea to view the item at its source to see the full metadata record.

### Links

- **VIEW MANIFEST:** opens the JSON file containing the manifest information in your browser
- **ALLMAPS EDITOR:** opens Allmaps Editor and populates the field with the item manifest
