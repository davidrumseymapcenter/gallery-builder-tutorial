## Item Cards

Item cards appear in a grid below the input panel as you add them. Each item or page you add to the gallery will have its own card. 

### Image

- Item thumbnail: click this to open the image in the viewing pane

### Metadata

- Title: note that long titles are truncated after four lines
- Author: if the source metadata lists multiple author types the card will only show the first one in the record
- Date
- Collection: any subgrouping of things the item is part of
- Attribution: information about the source institution or information on usage

Note that this represents a summary and that metadata handling varies by institution. It is a good idea to view the item at its source to see the full metadata record.

### Links

- VIEW ITEM: opens the record for the item at its source repository
- VIEW MANIFEST: opens the JSON file containing the manifest information in your browser
- ALLMAPS EDITOR: opens the Allmaps Editor and populates the entry field with the item manifest
