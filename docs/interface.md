## Understand the Interface

### Input Panel

This is the part of the tool where you add images, load existing galleries, and save your work. 

Once saved, the title of your gallery will appear at the top of the window. 

Also at the top there are three control links:
- GET HELP: opens the help page
- HIDE INPUTS: hides or reveals this input panel
- HIDE VIEWER: hides or reveals the zoom panel on the right side of the browser window

### Item Cards

Item cards appear in a grid below the input panel as you add them. Each item or page you add to the gallery will have its own card. 

#### Image
- Item thumbnail: click this to open the image in the viewing pane

#### Metadata
- Title: note that the title will be truncated after four lines
- Author: if the source metadata lists multiple author types the card will only show the first one
- Date
- Collection: any subgrouping of things the item is part of
- Attribution: information about the source institution or information on usage

Note that this represents a summary and that metadata handling varies by institution. It is a good idea to view the item at its source to see the full metadata record.

#### Links
- VIEW ITEM: opens the record for the item at its source repository
- VIEW MANIFEST: opens the JSON file containing the manifest information in your browser
- ALLMAPS EDITOR: opens the Allmaps Editor and populates the entry field with the item manifest 

### Viewing Pane
The viewing pane is on the right side of the gallery window and provides a window for examining the item images

- Clicking on the thumbnail image on a card will open the image in the viewing pane to the right side of the browser window 
- Zoom in and out with the mouse scroll wheel and click and drag to pan
- Click and drag the vertical bar in the center to resize the viewing pane
