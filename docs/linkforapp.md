## 🔨 Build the deep link 

In Gist, with your gallery code visible in the page, 

1. Click the "Raw" button in the top-right corner

2. When the raw code window opens, copy the URL from your browser's address bar

3. Create your shareable link by adding it into this structure:

```html
https://davidrumseymapcenter.github.io/set-builder/?file=PASTE_GIST_RAW_URL_HERE
```

Example:

```html
https://davidrumseymapcenter.github.io/set-builder/?file=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/kristinallarsen/dd25a0e3fb0535d10d81b327a0d45454/raw/3b479ead4429474900b817bdfe0579d53cefa935/Ink%2520and%2520Empire
