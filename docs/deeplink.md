- Sign in (or skip for anonymous gist)

- Drag and drop your JSON file into the text box, or paste the contents

- In "Filename including extension" field, give it a descriptive name (e.g., "colonial-maps.json")

- Optionally add a description

- Click "Create public gist" (or "Create secret gist" for unlisted)

- Click the "Raw" button in the top-right corner

- Copy the URL from your browser's address bar

- Create your shareable link:

```html
