# Saving and Sharing

## ☁️ Put your code in the cloud

To share your gallery without moving the file to Drive or attaching it to email you can create a special link that will open your collection in the gallery builder in a browser window.

[This is an example](https://davidrumseymapcenter.github.io/set-builder/?file=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/kristinallarsen/dd25a0e3fb0535d10d81b327a0d45454/raw/3b479ead4429474900b817bdfe0579d53cefa935/Ink%2520and%2520Empire
){:target="_blank"}

- This is called a "deep link." To include your gallery in a deep link, it must be in the cloud somewhere -- you have to get it off your computer and into the internet. 

- This requires a little extra work to accomplish, but it is totally worth the effort.

## Working with Github "Gists"

- [**Gist**](https://gist.github.com){:target="_blank"} is a website operated by GitHub that allows users to save code snippets online without creating full-blown respositories.

- These code snippet files are called Gists. A straightforward way to get your collection into the cloud is to make a Gist that contains the code from your gallery JSON.

### Create a Gist account

- Go to [https://gist.github.com](https://gist.github.com){:target="_blank"}

- If you already have a GitHub account you can sign in with that.

- If not, create a new account.

{: .warning }
You can create Gists without an account. These are called "anonymous gists". The drawback is that once you make an anonymous gist there is no way for you to manage it, and it can't be changed or deleted.

## 🔗 Create a Sharable Link with GitHub Gist
- Navigate to where you saved your gallery file on your computer. 

- Open the browser window where Gist is open and drag and drop your JSON file into the text box.  You can also copy/paste its contents into the box. 

- In the "Filename including extension" field, give the Gist a descriptive name.

- Optionally add a description.

- Click "Create public Gist" or "Create secret Gist" to make it unlisted.

{: .highlight } 
🤫 Secret gists are fine! they can't be opened without the gallery builder link so there is no reason to make them public.
