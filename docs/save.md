## Save your work to your computer
- Choose a title for your gallery and type it in the field that says "Enter gallery name". Note that if you don't choose a name the tool will autogenerate one with today's date

- Click the Save Gallery button

- Navigate to your downloads folder (this may be your desktop) and find the file you just saved. It will have the title you chose with the suffix "-gallery.json"
