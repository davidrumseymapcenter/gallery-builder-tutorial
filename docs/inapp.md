# Save for use in this web app

## Exchanging files

- Save your gallery by typing a name in the field below “SAVE GALLERY” and click “Save File".

- A file will be saved to your desktop with a name like “coolmaps-gallery.json”. The suffix “-gallery” indicates a file that can be read by the gallery builder web app. 

{: .note-title }
You will be able to make changes to the gallery after saving it but you will need to save a new version of the document. 

## Share via Google Drive
- Access the [shared drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18hpn5Mntns-cf38rpj5CHfyaTS0BzlXu?usp=sharing) for this workshop

- Upload your gallery file to the drive

- After others in the workshop have added their files, select one and download it to your computer

- Open the [Gallery Builder](https://davidrumseymapcenter.github.io/set-builder){:target="_blank"} in a new browser window 

- Under the heading "LOAD GALLERY" click the Choose File button. Navigate to the file you just downloaded and open it

# Versioning and Collaboration

- Spend a few minutes modifying the gallery by adding and/or removing items and rearranging things.

- When you are happy with your work, click in the field with the gallery name in it and add your initials to the end of the name. 

- Click Save File

- Upload your modified gallery to the shared drive

- Select a modified file -- maybe your own was changed -- and download it

- Open the modified file to view changes

> Use a file naming convention (coolmaps01kl, coolmaps02kl) to keep track of your own versions as well as versions created by collaborators.
