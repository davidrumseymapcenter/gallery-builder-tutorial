- Choose an item and go to the record page. 

- Scroll to the bottom of the record. THe last text entry will be "IIIF Presentation Manifest." Right click on "Manifest (JSON/LD)" and copy the link address.

- Navigate back to the IIIF Gallery Builder. Paste the the manifest in the top field and click “Add Manifest(s)” 

## Add a manifest from a repository of your choice

- The IIIF Consortium maintains a list of participating institutions with links to screenshots that illustrate how to locate those manifests: [https://iiif.io/guides/finding_resources/](https://iiif.io/guides/finding_resources/){:target="_blank"}. 

- Choose a repository from the list to investigate

- Follow the instructions at the link to locate a manifest and add an image to your gallery.

*Note that the Gallery Builder tool does not yet perfectly ingest manifests from all institutions! Please email kllarsen@stanford.edu with requests to add compatibility for a particular manifest format, or add an issue to our repository: <https://github.com/davidrumseymapcenter/set-builder>*
