# Saving and Sharing

To open your gallery as a collection in a IIIF Viewer it must be hosted in the cloud.

In this step you will put the IIIF-compliant version of your gallery into a Gist and open it in Universal Viewer.
<hr>

## :link: Create a Sharable Link with GitHub Gist 
Same as before, but this time use the file that ends with "-manifest.json".

- Sign in (or skip for an anonymous gist)

- Drag and drop your JSON file into the text box, or paste its contents

- In "Filename including extension" field, give it a descriptive name ending with -manifest.json

- We are using "-manifest" to keep straight which files we have made that will work in the Gallery Builder and which ones will work in IIIF Viewers. You can leave it out or choose another method for distinguishing link types for yourself.

- Optionally add a description

- Click "Create public gist" or "Create secret gist" to make it unlisted

{: .highlight } 
:shushing_face: Secret gists are fine! they can't be opened without the gallery builder link so there is no reason to make them public. 

- Click the "Raw" button in the top-right corner

- Copy the URL from your browser's address bar
https://universalviewer.io/

## View your collection in Universal Viewer<hr>

Open the Universal Viewer website: [https://universalviewer.io/](https://universalviewer.io/){:target="_blank"}

- Scroll down until you see View a IIIF Manifest, then paste your link into the field and click "VIEW"

<hr>

## Some things to explore

- Can you find the title of your gallery?

- Can you find the titles of the items?

- What other information about the items do you see?

- Compare the metadata for the collection with the metadata for an object.
