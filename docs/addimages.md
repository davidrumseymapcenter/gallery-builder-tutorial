# Add Images to Your Gallery

## Finding Manifests in Other Collections

IIIF is used by dozens of institutions around the world. In this section of the workshop we will add links from a couple of popular sites and explore the list of other participating entities. 

## Add a manifest from DavidRumsey.com

DavidRumsey.com is an extraordinary source for images of historical maps. At the time of this writing, there are over 145,000 images on the site. It has purpose-built tools for finding maps within the collection, including a geospatial serach function and the ability to search for text wihin the map images. 

- Open an item record on DavidRumsey.com

- Find and click the dropdown menu that says SHARE.

- Click on the triangle to the left of the heading that says IIIF Manifests to reveal an additional field. Click the copy icon at right to copy the URL. 

- Navigate back to the IIIF Gallery Builder. Paste the the manifest in the top field and click “Add Manifest(s)”
