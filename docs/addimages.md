# Add Images to Your Gallery

## Finding Manifests in Other Collections

IIIF is used by dozens of institutions around the world. In this section of the workshop we will add links from a couple of popular sites and explore the list of other participating entities. 

## Add a manifest from DavidRumsey.com

[DavidRumsey.com](https://www.DavidRumsey.com){:target="_blank"} is an extraordinary source for images of historical maps. At the time of this writing, there are over 145,000 images on the site. It has purpose-built tools for finding maps within the collection, including a geospatial serach function and the ability to search for text wihin the map images. 

- Go to [DavidRumsey.com](https://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/view/all?res=1&sort=Pub_List_No_InitialSort){:target="_blank"} and choose an item to add to your gallery

- In the top navigation bar, find and click on the dropdown menu that says SHARE.
