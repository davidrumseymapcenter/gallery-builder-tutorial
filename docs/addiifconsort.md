# Add Images to Your Gallery

## Add a manifest from a repository of your choice

- The IIIF Consortium maintains a list of participating institutions with links to screenshots that illustrate how to locate those manifests: [https://iiif.io/guides/finding_resources/](https://iiif.io/guides/finding_resources/){:target="_blank"}. 

- Choose a repository from the list to investigate

- Follow the instructions at the link to locate a manifest and add an image to your gallery.

- If time permits, try adding items from additional repositories.

*Note that the Gallery Builder tool does not yet perfectly ingest manifests from all institutions! Please email kllarsen@stanford.edu with requests to add compatibility for a particular manifest format, or add an issue to our repository: <https://github.com/davidrumseymapcenter/set-builder>*
