# Create a Gallery

## Open the Gallery Builder tool

## Copy a manifest

- We have provided you with a few manifests to start out. 

- Select one of the links below and copy it using the clipboard icon in the upper right corner of the box.

## Add the manifest to your gallery
- In the IIIF Gallery Builder tool, paste the manifest into the top field (*the box that says 'Enter IIIF manifest URLs (comma-separated)'*) and click “Add Manifest(s)”

- If the item contains multiple pages, you will see a pop-up window where you can select the desired page or pages. Choose the pages to include and click "Add Selected Pages"

- A card or cards should appear below the Input Panel containing the thumbnail and metadata for the item you just added.
