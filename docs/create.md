## Find a IIIF Manifest in Searchworks
- Go to [Searchworks.stanford.edu](https://searchworks.stanford.edu/?f%5Bformat_hsim%5D%5B%5D=Map&f%5Bformat_hsim%5D%5B%5D=Image&f%5Blibrary%5D%5B%5D=SDR&f%5Blibrary%5D%5B%5D=RUMSEY-MAP&sort=year-asc) and find a record for a map that includes an image. 

- In the item record, click on the “hamburger” menu in the upper left corner of the box containing the image to toggle the sidebar

- Scroll to the bottom of the sidebar and locate the IIIF Manifest

- (It is a link that starts with "https://purl.stanford.edu/...
 and ends with "manifest")

- Right click on the clink and click "Copy Link Address"

## Add the manifest to your gallery
- In the IIIF Gallery Builder tool, paste the manifest into the top field (*the box that says 'Enter IIIF manifest URLs (comma-separated)'*) and click “Add Manifest(s)”

- If the item contains multiple pages, you will see a pop-up window where you can select the desired page or pages. Choose the pages to include and click "Add Selected Pages"

- A card or cards should appear below the Input Panel containing the thumbnail and metadata for the item you just added.

- _*Add 2 or more additional items following this same workflow.*_ 

## Rearrange your collection
- You can rearrange cards as needed by dragging and dropping. (Click within the card outline but *outside of the thumbnail image* to drag a card.)

- If you need to remove a card, click the x in the upper right corner.

## Change the view
- Use the control links at upper right to hide and show the input panel and hide and show the viewing pane. 

- Change the size of the viewing pane by dragging the vertical grey bar to your desired location.

## Save your work to your computer
