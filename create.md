- In the item record, click on the “hamburger” menu in the upper left corner of the box containing the image to toggle the sidebar

- (It is a link that starts with "https://purl.stanford.edu/...
 and ends with "manifest")

- Right click on the clink and click "Copy Link Address"

## Add the manifest to your gallery
- In the IIIF Gallery Builder tool, paste the manifest into the top field and click “Add Manifest(s)”

- A card should appear below the Input Panel that shows the thumbnail and metadata for the item you just added

## Rearrange your collection
- You can rearrange cards as needed by dragging and dropping. (Click within the box but outside of the thumbnail image to drag a card.)
- If you need to remove a card, click the x in the upper right corner.

Change the view
