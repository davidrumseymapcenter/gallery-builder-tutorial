# Create a Gallery

## Open the Gallery Builder
- https://davidrumseymapcenter.github.io/set-builder/

## Find a IIIF Manifest 
- Go to Searchworks.stanford.edu and find a record for a map that includes an image. 

- In the item record, click on the “hamburger” menu in the upper left corner of the box containing the image to toggle the sidebar

- Scroll to the bottom of the sidebar and locate the IIIF Manifest

- (It is a link that starts with "https://purl.stanford.edu/...
 and ends with "manifest")

- Right click on the clink and click "Copy Link Address"

## Add the manifest to your gallery
- In the IIIF Gallery Builder tool, paste the manifest into the top field and click “Add Manifest(s)”

- If the item has multiple pages, you will see a pop-up window where you can select the desired page or pages.  

- A card should appear below the Input Panel that shows the thumbnail and metadata for the item you just added

- Add 2 or more additional items following this same workflow. 

## Save your work
- Choose a title for your gallery and type it in the field that says "Enter gallery name". Note that if you don't choose a name the tool will autogenerate one with today's date
- Click the Save Gallery button
- Navigate to your desktop and find the file you just saved. It will have the title you chose with the suffix "-gallery"
- Right click on the file and choose "Open Link with" and select your blower of choice (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, etc.)
- Your gallery should open in a new tab
